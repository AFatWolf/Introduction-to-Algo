# 1. The roles of Algorithm in computing
## 1.1 Algorithm
### A few defnitions:
Informally, an ***algorithm*** takes a set of values, as **inputs** processes them and produces another set of values, as **outputs**.

A problem defines a desired relationship between ***inputs*** and ***outputs***. ***Algoirthm*** serves as a tool, a procedure to achieve that relationship. 

**An instance of a problem** is an example input sequence for the problem.  We say an algorith is **correct** if for every input instance, it halts **correct** coresponding output. An **incorrect** one might not halt at all or produces the wrong output in one of the instance.

**Data structure** is a way to store data for more convinient *access* and *modification*.

### What kind of problems are solved by algorithm?
Pratical application of algorithms are various:
* The Human Genome Project: identified almost 100,000 genes in human DNA, stored in database for analysis.
* In Internet, a huge volumes of data are managed and manipulated: for example, algorithms are used to find good routes for the data to transfer.
* Search engine
* e.t.c

*(The number of applications are enormous. Check out the book for more examples.)*

### Parallelism
Computers are having more and more cores, therefore compute faster and faster. To make use of the advatage of having multiple cores, ***multithreaded algorithm*** are introduced in this book.

## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology
What **Algorithm** aims at is the resources of the computer: **memory space** and **speed**. How efficient the alogrithms is shows at how efficient the memory space and speed is.

Algorithms lurks in many other aspects of computers' technology, such as:
- Advanced computer architectures
- Fabrication technology
- Easy to use, intuitive, graphical user interface (GUIs)
- Object-oriented systems
- Integrated Web technologies.
- Fast networking, both wired and wireless
